# Vault Security Health Scorecard Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive security health analysis system for HashiCorp Vault clusters, following the **hybrid architecture** pattern recommended from a principal engineering perspective.

## Implemented Tools

### Core Individual Tools (Phase 1)

#### System Health and Status
- **`get_health_status`** - Retrieves Vault cluster health including initialization, sealing status, and HA mode
- **`get_seal_status`** - Gets detailed seal status information including seal type, threshold, and cluster details

#### Audit Management  
- **`list_audit_devices`** - Lists all enabled audit devices with their configurations

#### Policy Management
- **`list_policies`** - Lists all ACL policies with optional rule inclusion

#### UI Configuration
- **`get_ui_headers`** - Retrieves custom UI headers for environment identification

### Orchestration Tool (Phase 2)

#### Comprehensive Analysis
- **`analyze_security_health`** - Master orchestration tool that:
  - Collects data from multiple Vault API endpoints
  - Supports parallel and sequential execution modes
  - Provides configurable scope (choose which checks to run)
  - Aggregates results into structured JSON format
  - Handles partial failures gracefully
  - Includes metadata about collection process

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. **Composability**
```bash
# Individual tools for debugging
vault-mcp-server call get_health_status
vault-mcp-server call list_audit_devices

# Or comprehensive analysis for dashboards
vault-mcp-server call analyze_security_health --parallel=true
```

### 2. **Configurability**
```json
{
  "parallel": true,
  "fail_fast": false, 
  "include_health": true,
  "include_audit": true,
  "include_policies": false,
  "include_auth_methods": true,
  "include_mounts": true,
  "include_ui_config": true
}
```

### 3. **Graceful Degradation**
If individual checks fail, the system continues and reports errors in metadata:
```json
{
  "health": {...},
  "audit_devices": [...],
  "policies": null,
  "metadata": {
    "errors": ["Policies collection failed: insufficient permissions"],
    "warnings": ["UI headers collection took >30s"]
  }
}
```

## Data Structure

The orchestration tool returns a comprehensive data structure:

```json
{
  "health": {
    "initialized": true,
    "sealed": false,
    "standby": false,
    "version": "1.15.0"
  },
  "seal_status": {
    "type": "shamir",
    "sealed": false,
    "t": 3,
    "n": 5
  },
  "audit_devices": [
    {
      "type": "file",
      "path": "audit/",
      "description": "File audit device"
    }
  ],
  "auth_methods": [...],
  "policies": [...],
  "mounts": [...],
  "ui_headers": {...},
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "vault_version": "1.15.0",
    "scope": ["health", "audit", "policies"],
    "errors": [],
    "warnings": []
  }
}
```

## Future Extensions

### Phase 3: LLM Integration
The structured JSON output is ready for LLM analysis:

1. **Prompt Engineering**: System prompts that define security best practices
2. **Analysis Logic**: LLM evaluates the collected data against standards
3. **Scorecard Generation**: Returns structured recommendations with scores

### Phase 4: Remediation Actions
Additional tools for automated fixes:
- `enable_audit_device`
- `update_policy_rules`  
- `configure_mount_ttls`
- `set_ui_headers`

## Operational Features

### Error Handling
- **Partial failures**: Continue analysis even if some checks fail
- **Timeout management**: Individual timeouts for each data collection
- **Permission awareness**: Graceful handling of insufficient permissions

### Performance
- **Parallel execution**: Concurrent API calls for faster analysis
- **Selective scope**: Only run needed checks to reduce load
- **Efficient batching**: Minimize Vault API round trips

### Observability
- **Structured logging**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting
- **Metrics collection**: Performance and success/failure rates
- **Audit trail**: Track what data was collected when

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Individual tool functionality
- Error handling scenarios
- Data structure validation

### Integration Tests  
- End-to-end orchestration flows
- Vault API compatibility
- Performance benchmarking

### Security Tests
- Permission boundary testing
- Data privacy validation
- Error information leakage prevention

## Deployment Considerations

### Permissions
The MCP server needs these Vault capabilities:
```hcl
# Required capabilities for security health analysis
path "sys/health" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "sys/seal-status" {
  capabilities = ["read"] 
}

path "sys/audit" {
  capabilities = ["list"]
}

path "sys/policies/acl" {
  capabilities = ["list"]
}

path "sys/policies/acl/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "sys/auth" {
  capabilities = ["list"]
}

path "sys/mounts" {
  capabilities = ["list"]
}

path "sys/config/ui/headers" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
```

### Scaling
- **Horizontal scaling**: Multiple MCP server instances
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in backoff for Vault API calls  
- **Caching**: Optional caching layer for frequent analyses

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the Vault Best Practices Health Scorecard with room for future enhancements and enterprise-grade operational characteristics.
