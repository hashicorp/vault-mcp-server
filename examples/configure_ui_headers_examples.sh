# Example script demonstrating the configure_ui_headers tool usage
# This script shows common patterns for configuring UI headers in different environments

echo "=== Vault UI Headers Configuration Examples ==="
echo

# Example 1: Production Environment Setup
echo "1. Setting up Production environment headers..."
echo "   Headers: Environment=Production, Cluster=prod-us-east-1, Warning=PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT"
echo "   Command: mcp call configure_ui_headers with JSON format"
echo '   {"headers": "{\"X-Environment\":\"Production\",\"X-Cluster\":\"prod-us-east-1\",\"X-Warning\":\"‚ö†Ô∏è PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT ‚ö†Ô∏è\"}", "operation": "update"}'
echo

# Example 2: Staging Environment Setup  
echo "2. Setting up Staging environment headers..."
echo "   Headers: Environment=Staging, Cluster=staging-us-west-2"
echo "   Command: mcp call configure_ui_headers with key=value format"
echo '   {"headers": "X-Environment=Staging,X-Cluster=staging-us-west-2,X-Notice=Testing Environment", "operation": "replace"}'
echo

# Example 3: Development Environment Setup
echo "3. Setting up Development environment headers..."
echo "   Headers: Environment=Development, Version=latest, Owner=DevTeam"
echo "   Command: mcp call configure_ui_headers"
echo '   {"headers": "X-Environment=Development,X-Version=latest,X-Owner=DevTeam,X-Notice=üîß Dev Environment", "operation": "update"}'
echo

# Example 4: Adding temporary maintenance notice
echo "4. Adding temporary maintenance notice..."
echo "   Command: mcp call configure_ui_headers"
echo '   {"headers": "X-Maintenance=Scheduled maintenance window: Sunday 2AM-4AM UTC", "operation": "update"}'
echo

# Example 5: Removing temporary headers
echo "5. Removing temporary headers after maintenance..."
echo "   Command: mcp call configure_ui_headers to delete specific headers"
echo '   {"headers": "X-Maintenance", "operation": "delete"}'
echo

# Example 6: Compliance setup for financial environment
echo "6. Financial services compliance setup..."
echo "   Headers: Environment, Compliance notice, Audit info"
echo "   Command: mcp call configure_ui_headers"
echo '   {"headers": "{\"X-Environment\":\"PROD-FINANCIAL\",\"X-Compliance\":\"SOX Compliant Environment\",\"X-Audit\":\"All access logged\"}", "operation": "replace"}'
echo

# Example 7: Multi-region setup
echo "7. Multi-region environment identification..."
echo "   Headers: Environment, Region, Cluster"
echo "   Command: mcp call configure_ui_headers"
echo '   {"headers": "X-Environment=Production,X-Region=EU-WEST-1,X-Cluster=prod-eu-west-1-cluster-01,X-Timezone=CET", "operation": "update"}'
echo

echo "=== Best Practices ==="
echo "‚Ä¢ Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., X-Environment, X-Cluster)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Include visual indicators (emojis) for critical environments"
echo "‚Ä¢ Keep header values concise and informative"
echo "‚Ä¢ Use 'update' operation to add headers, 'replace' to completely change them"
echo "‚Ä¢ Use 'delete' operation to remove temporary notices"
echo "‚Ä¢ Test header configurations in development before applying to production"
echo

echo "=== Security Notes ==="
echo "‚Ä¢ Headers are visible to all Vault UI users"
echo "‚Ä¢ Do not include sensitive information in header values"
echo "‚Ä¢ Consider impact on performance with many headers"
echo "‚Ä¢ Headers are stored in Vault configuration (backed up with config)"
